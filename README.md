## About

Normally I would check in with the relevant stakeholders to ensure my solution
satisfies the requirements completely. However, it's the weekend and my solution needs
to be delivered on Monday morning, so I have interpreted the requirements as follows:

* Requirement: add filters for Fellowship, Active/inactive and Alphabetically
  * Usually I would assume that a "filter" would only display the
records that match, but in this case it seemed more useful to display all of the records,
sorted by the chosen filter.
  * For the Alphabetical filter I sorted by last name.
* Requirement: a search box to search by fellows information
  * I included the following fields in the search:
    * Name (first and last)
    * Fellowship, and
    * About
